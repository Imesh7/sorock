A Multi-Raft implementation in Rust language.

[Documentation (mdbook)](https://akiradeveloper.github.io/sorock/)

## Features

![](doc/src/images/multi-raft.png)

- Supports Multi-Raft. Mutliple Raft processes can coexist in a single OS process so they can share resources efficiently.
  - Tested with 1000 shards per node.
  - Heartbeats in shards are batched to reduce the network overhead.
- Based on [Tonic](https://github.com/hyperium/tonic) and efficient gRPC streaming is exploited in log replication and snapshot.
- Efficient default backend implementation using [redb](https://github.com/cberner/redb).
  - Writes in shards are batched in one transaction. 
- Phi Accrual Failure Detector is used for leader failure detection.
  - The adaptive algorithm allows you to not choose a fixed timeout number before deployment and to deploy Raft node in even geo-distributed environment where the latency between nodes isn't identical.
